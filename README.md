This mini-course present how to create a web scraping from scratch using PHP. Even those who are not familiar with PHP but understand basic programming concepts will be able to reproduce the steps shown in this mini-course. And, with a little more time, you can use the techniques presented to create your PHP script.

## Content

The mini-course starts by presenting how to set up the environment (on Windows). Then, it goes through understanding Web Crawler and Web Scraping, PHP basics concepts overview, and creating a simple script to collect data from websites. Finally, we'll improve the created code using more advanced PHP techniques.

**Note:** During the mini-course, there are some jumps between basics and intermediate PHP concepts to see a little more about the language features.
